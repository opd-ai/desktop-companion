# Desktop Dating Simulator - Feature Enhancement Roadmap

## CODEBASE ANALYSIS

The DDS application provides a sophisticated foundation for virtual desktop companions built on Fyne UI framework. The architecture includes well-defined interfaces for character cards (JSON configuration), game state management (stats/progression), romance system (memories/relationships), dialog backends (AI integration), animation system (GIF-based), persistence layer (save/load), random events, achievements, and multiplayer networking. Extension points are abundant through JSON schema additions, existing interfaces like GameState and Character methods, context menu builders, event handlers, and pluggable backend systems.
