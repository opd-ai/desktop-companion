### Phase 2: Major Components [2-3 weeks]

1. **ComfyUI Animation Asset Pipeline**
   - Description: Implement automated GIF asset generation using local ComfyUI instance for character animations
   - Implementation steps (see GIF_PLAN.md for complete details):
     a. Develop ComfyUI HTTP/WebSocket client integration (`lib/comfyui/`)
     b. Create base character generation from archetype descriptions
     c. Generate mood/activity variants (idle, talking, happy, sad, hungry, eating, romance-specific)
     d. Convert static sequences to optimized GIF animations with transparency
     e. Implement batch processing for all 19+ character archetypes
   - Current Progress (Sep 15 2025):
     * Initial `lib/comfyui` package created with minimal HTTP client (`SubmitWorkflow`, `GetQueueStatus`)
     * Config validation, retry w/ backoff, contextual error wrapping implemented
     * >80% unit test coverage for current code (success, retry, exhaustion, invalid JSON, context cancel, empty job id)
     * Purpose: establish stable base before adding WebSocket monitoring & workflow templating
     * WebSocket progress monitoring (`MonitorJob`) implemented (streaming progress frames, cancellation & malformed JSON handling)
     * Coverage maintained >80% after WebSocket addition (success, malformed JSON, dial error, cancel scenarios tested)
     * Next Steps: (1) Implement workflow template loader (2) Add result retrieval & file persistence layer (3) Introduce batch queue abstraction
     * Risk Reduction: Early tests lock API shape; future additions can extend interface without breaking callers
  * UPDATE (Sep 15 2025 - later): Workflow template loader IMPLEMENTED (`TemplateLoader` in `lib/comfyui/workflow.go`). Features: read‑through caching, context cancellation, JSON round‑trip deep copy for isolation, deterministic ID fallback, placeholder substitution for `{{KEY}}` tokens in string values across nodes & meta. Comprehensive tests added (`workflow_test.go`): cache reuse, missing file, invalid JSON, substitution (nested array/map), deep copy integrity, context cancellation, generated ID. Coverage for comfyui package now 82.2% (>80% target). No external dependencies added (stdlib only). Next Steps revised: (1) Result retrieval & file persistence layer (2) Batch queue abstraction / backpressure (3) Workflow discovery & advanced validation.
