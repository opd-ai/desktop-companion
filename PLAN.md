## Phase 2: Implementation Plan

### Strategy Overview

**Approach**: Minimally invasive JSON-first configuration extensions that:
1. Preserve each character's core identity and specialization
2. Add missing features through optional JSON sections
3. Maintain backward compatibility
4. Require zero Go code changes

### Priority 1: Universal Core Features (All Characters)

These features enhance functionality without changing character personality:

#### 1.1 Basic Game Features for Non-Game Characters
**Target Characters**: Default, Markov Example, News Example

**Implementation**: Add optional game features with personality-appropriate values:

```json
{
  "stats": {
    "happiness": {"initial": 90, "max": 100, "degradationRate": 0.1},
    "energy": {"initial": 85, "max": 100, "degradationRate": 0.2}
  },
  "gameRules": {
    "statsDecayInterval": 300,
    "autoSaveInterval": 600,
    "moodBasedAnimations": true,
    "deathEnabled": false
  },
  "interactions": {
    "pet": {
      "triggers": ["click"],
      "effects": {"happiness": 5, "energy": 2},
      "responses": ["[Personality-appropriate response]"],
      "cooldown": 30
    }
  }
}
```

**Rationale**: Adds basic interactivity without compromising the character's primary purpose.

#### 1.2 Dialog Backend for Non-AI Characters  
**Target Characters**: Romance, Easy, Challenge, Specialist, Social Bot

**Implementation**: Add simple dialog backend configuration:

```json
{
  "dialogBackend": {
    "enabled": true,
    "defaultBackend": "simple_random",
    "confidenceThreshold": 0.3,
    "fallbackChain": ["simple_random"]
  }
}
```

**Rationale**: Provides fallback AI dialog without changing existing personality or responses.

### Priority 2: Personality-Appropriate Advanced Features

#### 2.1 Romance Features for Compatible Characters
**Target Characters**: Easy, Specialist (gentle personalities), Social Bot

**Implementation**: Add light romance features that match personality:

```json
{
  "personality": {
    "traits": {
      "shyness": 0.8,      // For Specialist
      "romanticism": 0.3,   // Low for Easy
      "socialness": 0.9     // High for Social Bot
    }
  },
  "stats": {
    "affection": {"initial": 0, "max": 50, "degradationRate": 0.05}
  }
}
```

**Rationale**: Adds romance capability while maintaining character's core personality (shy, gentle, social).

#### 2.2 Multiplayer Features for Social Characters
**Target Characters**: Romance, Default, Easy (sociable characters)

**Implementation**: Add basic multiplayer capability:

```json
{
  "multiplayer": {
    "enabled": true,
    "botCapable": false,
    "networkID": "[character_type]_v1",
    "maxPeers": 3
  }
}
```

**Rationale**: Social characters benefit from networking without becoming bots.

### Priority 3: Optional Specialized Features

#### 3.1 News Features for Intelligent Characters
**Target Characters**: Default, Markov Example, Romance (intellectual types)

**Implementation**: Add optional news reading with personality filters:

```json
{
  "newsFeatures": {
    "enabled": true,
    "updateInterval": 1800,
    "readingPersonality": "casual",
    "preferredCategories": ["general", "lifestyle"],
    "feeds": [
      {
        "url": "https://example.com/gentle-news.xml",
        "category": "lifestyle",
        "keywords": ["positive", "uplifting"]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Rationale**: Intellectual characters can share news without becoming news-focused.

#### 3.2 General Events for Interactive Characters
**Target Characters**: All characters (personality-appropriate scenarios)

**Implementation**: Add character-specific event scenarios:

```json
{
  "generalEvents": [
    {
      "name": "daily_reflection",
      "description": "A quiet moment of thought",
      "responses": ["[Character's personality-specific reflection]"],
      "choices": [
        {
          "text": "Share your thoughts",
          "effects": {"happiness": 5}
        }
      ],
      "requirements": {"happiness": {"min": 30}},
      "cooldown": 3600
    }
  ]
}
```

**Rationale**: Provides interactive scenarios tailored to each character's personality.

### Priority 4: Experimental Features (Optional)

#### 4.1 Battle System for Competitive Characters
**Target Characters**: Challenge, Social Bot (competitive types)

**Implementation**: Add optional battle configuration:

```json
{
  "battleSystem": {
    "enabled": true,
    "battleStats": {
      "hp": {"base": 100, "max": 100},
      "attack": {"base": 20, "max": 50}
    },
    "aiDifficulty": "normal",
    "requireAnimations": false
  }
}
```

**Rationale**: Only competitive characters gain battle features.

#### 4.2 Gift System for Affectionate Characters
**Target Characters**: Romance, Easy, Default (caring personalities)

**Implementation**: Add gift system for appropriate characters:

```json
{
  "giftSystem": {
    "enabled": true,
    "maxSlots": 5,
    "categories": ["flowers", "books", "treats"],
    "personalizedGifts": true
  }
}
```

**Rationale**: Caring characters appreciate gift-giving mechanics.

4. **Code Minimality**: Zero Go code changes required
5. **User Experience**: Enhanced functionality without complexity increase

## Conclusion

This plan achieves feature-completeness across all characters while maintaining their unique personalities through:

1. **JSON-First Approach**: All changes use existing configuration mechanisms
2. **Personality-Appropriate Features**: Features are added only where they enhance the character's core identity
3. **Optional Architecture**: All new features are optional and don't affect characters that don't use them
4. **Gradual Implementation**: Staged rollout allows for testing and validation at each step

The result will be a more feature-rich application where each character maintains its distinctive personality while gaining access to the full range of available functionality.
