    always_on_top_test.go:9: Regression test: Always-on-top window configuration (Bug #1 - RESOLVED)
    always_on_top_test.go:10: Description: Validates that always-on-top configuration remains implemented
    always_on_top_test.go:16: Fixed behavior: Desktop window creation includes always-on-top configuration
    always_on_top_test.go:17: Fixed behavior: configureAlwaysOnTop function is called during window setup
    always_on_top_test.go:18: Fixed behavior: Window title is removed for cleaner overlay appearance
    always_on_top_test.go:20: Implementation approach:
    always_on_top_test.go:21: - Uses available Fyne capabilities for best-effort always-on-top behavior
    always_on_top_test.go:22: - Follows 'lazy programmer' principle by avoiding platform-specific code
    always_on_top_test.go:23: - Provides clear documentation of Fyne's limitations
    always_on_top_test.go:25: Regression test PASSED: Always-on-top configuration is implemented
    always_on_top_test.go:26: Status: RESOLVED (commit 040d1c2, 2025-08-25)
