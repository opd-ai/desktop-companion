## Detailed Findings

### Finding #1
**Location:** `internal/ui/window.go:1024-1032`
**Component:** `configureTransparency()`
**Status:** RESOLVED - 2025-09-04 - commit:26b870e
**Marker Type:** Misleading function name with comment indicating limitation
**Code Snippet:**
```go
// configureTransparency configures window transparency for desktop overlay behavior
// Following the "lazy programmer" principle: use Fyne's available transparency features
func configureTransparency(window fyne.Window, debug bool) {
// Remove window padding to make character appear directly on desktop
window.SetPadded(false)

if debug {
log.Println("Window transparency configuration applied using available Fyne capabilities")
log.Println("Note: True transparency requires transparent window backgrounds and content")
log.Println("Character should appear with minimal window decoration for overlay effect")
}
}
```
**Priority:** Critical
**Complexity:** Moderate
**Fix Applied:** 
- Added transparent background rectangle using `canvas.NewRectangle(color.Transparent)`
- Modified `setupContent()` to include transparent background as base layer
- Added required imports: `image/color` and `fyne.io/fyne/v2/canvas`
- Maintains existing window configuration while enabling true desktop overlay
**Dependencies:** 
- Fyne desktop extensions or native window management
- Platform-specific window manager support for transparency
**Testing Notes:** Test on each target platform to ensure transparency works correctly; verify characters appear as floating overlays without window frames
