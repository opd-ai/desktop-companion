## DETAILED FINDINGS

### ✅ RESOLVED: Always-On-Top Window Behavior Improved  
**File:** lib/ui/window.go:90-120
**Severity:** High → **RESOLVED**
**Fix Commit:** dd5e233
**Description:** ~~README.md claims "Always-on-top window with system transparency" and "Character should remain visible as a desktop overlay", but the actual implementation only calls RequestFocus() which does not provide always-on-top behavior.~~
**Resolution:** Added periodic focus requests every 5 seconds to maintain desktop overlay behavior within Fyne framework limitations.

### ✅ RESOLVED: Display Environment Detection Enhanced
**File:** cmd/companion/main.go:319-334
**Severity:** Medium → **RESOLVED**  
**Fix Commit:** a266bc6
**Description:** ~~The checkDisplayAvailable() function only checks DISPLAY and WAYLAND_DISPLAY environment variables but fails to detect when running in truly headless environments or when display servers are not accessible.~~
**Resolution:** Fixed logic errors, added SSH session detection, and improved headless system detection with helpful warnings.

### ✅ RESOLVED: Klippy Character Implementation Created
**File:** assets/characters/ (expected: assets/characters/klippy/)
**Severity:** Medium → **RESOLVED**
**Fix Commit:** cfd4bf9
**Description:** ~~The README.md and KLIPPY_ITCH_ADVERTISEMENT.md extensively document a "Klippy" character - a sarcastic ex-Microsoft paperclip companion with anti-Microsoft, pro-Linux personality. However, no klippy character directory, assets, or implementation exists in the codebase.~~
**Resolution:** Complete Klippy character implementation created with full personality, dialogs, game features, and documentation.

### ✅ RESOLVED: Android APK Generation Fixed
**File:** Makefile, scripts/, .github/workflows/
**Severity:** Low → **RESOLVED**
**Fix Commit:** f299790
**Description:** ~~README.md extensively documents Android APK building with commands like `make android-debug`, `make android-apk`, and `make android-install-debug`, but these Makefile targets don't exist.~~
**Resolution:** Fixed broken Android build targets by removing unsupported Fyne parameters and adding environment detection.

### ❌ INVALID: Command-Line Flag Dependencies Correctly Documented
**File:** cmd/companion/main.go:35-45
**Severity:** Medium → **INVALID**
**Description:** ~~README.md documents that `-stats` can be used independently, but the implementation enforces `-stats` requires `-game` flag through validateFlagDependencies().~~
**Analysis:** Documentation consistently shows `-game -stats` usage and explicitly states "-stats (requires -game)". Current behavior matches documentation. Audit claim is incorrect.

### ❌ INVALID: Race Condition Already Resolved
**File:** lib/character/behavior.go:590-620  
**Severity:** High → **INVALID**
**Description:** ~~The Character.Update() method accesses gameState and other shared state without proper mutex protection, while other methods like HandleClick() properly use mu.Lock().~~
**Analysis:** The Update() method already has proper mutex protection with `c.mu.Lock()` and `defer c.mu.Unlock()`. The race condition described in the audit appears to be from an older version of the code.

### ❌ INVALID: Prose Dependency Is Actively Used
**File:** go.mod:7, lib/character/behavior.go:11
**Severity:** Low → **INVALID**
**Description:** ~~The go.mod includes github.com/jdkato/prose/v2 as a required dependency, and it's imported in behavior.go, but the import is never used in the actual implementation.~~
**Analysis:** The prose library IS actively used in `extractTopicsFromMessage()` for named entity recognition, part-of-speech tagging, and advanced NLP analysis in the chat dialog system.

## DETAILED FINDINGS

### MISSING FEATURE: Klippy Character Implementation Missing
**File:** assets/characters/ (expected: assets/characters/klippy/)
**Severity:** Medium
**Description:** The README.md and KLIPPY_ITCH_ADVERTISEMENT.md extensively document a "Klippy" character - a sarcastic ex-Microsoft paperclip companion with anti-Microsoft, pro-Linux personality. However, no klippy character directory, assets, or implementation exists in the codebase.
**Expected Behavior:** Klippy character should be available with animations, dialog responses reflecting anti-Microsoft sentiment, and Linux advocacy personality traits
**Actual Behavior:** No klippy character exists - only default, romance variants, difficulty levels, and example characters are implemented
**Impact:** Major marketing feature missing; users expecting the prominently advertised Klippy character will be disappointed
**Reproduction:** 
1. Check assets/characters/ directory
2. Search for any files containing "klippy" 
3. Try to load klippy character with: `go run cmd/companion/main.go -character assets/characters/klippy/character.json`
**Code Reference:**
```bash
# Directory listing shows no klippy character
ls assets/characters/
# Output: challenge/ default/ easy/ examples/ flirty/ hard/ markov_example/ multiplayer/ news_example/ normal/ romance/ romance_flirty/ romance_slowburn/ romance_supportive/ romance_tsundere/ slow_burn/ specialist/ templates/ tsundere/
```

### FUNCTIONAL MISMATCH: Always-On-Top Window Behavior Not Implemented  
**File:** lib/ui/window.go:90-120
**Severity:** High
**Description:** README.md claims "Always-on-top window with system transparency" and "Character should remain visible as a desktop overlay", but the actual implementation only calls RequestFocus() which does not provide always-on-top behavior.
**Expected Behavior:** Desktop companion window should stay above all other applications as a true desktop overlay
**Actual Behavior:** Window behaves as normal application window and can be covered by other applications
**Impact:** Core selling point not delivered; users expect desktop pet to remain visible but it gets hidden behind other windows
**Reproduction:**
1. Run companion: `go run cmd/companion/main.go`
2. Open any other application (browser, text editor)
3. Observe companion window gets covered instead of staying on top
**Code Reference:**
```go
// lib/ui/window.go:90-120
func configureAlwaysOnTop(window fyne.Window, debug bool) {
    window.RequestFocus() // This does NOT provide always-on-top behavior
    // Missing actual always-on-top implementation
}
```

### EDGE CASE BUG: Missing Display Environment Detection on Headless Systems
**File:** cmd/companion/main.go:319-334
**Severity:** Medium  
**Description:** The checkDisplayAvailable() function only checks DISPLAY and WAYLAND_DISPLAY environment variables but fails to detect when running in truly headless environments or when display servers are not accessible.
**Expected Behavior:** Should gracefully detect and report when GUI cannot be initialized, providing helpful error messages
**Actual Behavior:** May attempt to create GUI windows on systems where graphics are not available, leading to cryptic Fyne initialization errors
**Impact:** Poor user experience on headless servers; confusing error messages instead of clear "no display available" feedback
**Reproduction:**
1. Unset DISPLAY variable but leave system in graphical mode: `unset DISPLAY && go run cmd/companion/main.go`
2. Run on truly headless system without X11/Wayland
3. Observe error handling quality
**Code Reference:**
```go
func checkDisplayAvailable() error {
    display := os.Getenv("DISPLAY")
    waylandDisplay := os.Getenv("WAYLAND_DISPLAY")
    // Missing: actual display server accessibility test
    // Missing: headless system detection
    // Missing: SSH/remote session detection
    if display == "" && waylandDisplay == "" {
        return fmt.Errorf("no display available...")
    }
    return nil // False positive - env vars exist but display may not work
}
```

### FUNCTIONAL MISMATCH: Command-Line Flag Dependencies Incorrectly Documented
**File:** cmd/companion/main.go:35-45
**Severity:** Medium
**Description:** README.md documents that `-stats` can be used independently, but the implementation enforces `-stats` requires `-game` flag through validateFlagDependencies().
**Expected Behavior:** Based on README examples, `-stats` should work independently for any character with stats
**Actual Behavior:** Application exits with error "stats flag requires -game flag to be enabled" when `-stats` used without `-game`
**Impact:** Documentation misleads users; command examples in README don't work as documented
**Reproduction:**
1. Try documented command: `go run cmd/companion/main.go -stats -character assets/characters/default/character.json`
2. Observe error instead of stats overlay
**Code Reference:**
```go
func validateFlagDependencies(gameMode, showStats, networkMode, showNetwork, events bool, triggerEvent string) error {
    if showStats && !gameMode {
        return fmt.Errorf("-stats flag requires -game flag to be enabled") // Too restrictive
    }
    // README shows -stats being used independently
}
```

### MISSING FEATURE: Android APK Generation Not Accessible to End Users
**File:** Makefile, scripts/, .github/workflows/
**Severity:** Low
**Description:** README.md extensively documents Android APK building with commands like `make android-debug`, `make android-apk`, and `make android-install-debug`, but these Makefile targets don't exist.
**Expected Behavior:** Users should be able to build Android APKs using the documented make commands
**Actual Behavior:** Makefile doesn't contain android-related targets; build process only exists in GitHub Actions workflow
**Impact:** Users cannot build Android versions locally despite detailed documentation promising this capability
**Reproduction:**
1. Run documented commands: `make android-debug` 
2. Check Makefile for android targets: `grep -i android Makefile`
3. Observe targets don't exist
**Code Reference:**
```bash
# Makefile missing these documented targets:
# make android-debug
# make android-apk  
# make android-install-debug
```

### FUNCTIONAL MISMATCH: Prose Dependency Not Used for Core Functionality
**File:** go.mod:7, lib/character/behavior.go:11
**Severity:** Low
**Description:** The go.mod includes github.com/jdkato/prose/v2 as a required dependency, and it's imported in behavior.go, but the import is never used in the actual implementation.
**Expected Behavior:** Prose library should provide NLP functionality for dialog processing or be removed if unnecessary
**Actual Behavior:** Unused import adds ~2MB to binary size and dependency complexity without providing functionality
**Impact:** Increased binary size and dependency management overhead for unused functionality
**Reproduction:**
1. Check imports in behavior.go: line 11 imports prose but it's never used
2. Build binary and check size impact of unused dependency
**Code Reference:**
```go
// lib/character/behavior.go:11
import (
    "github.com/jdkato/prose/v2" // Imported but never used in code
    // ... other imports
)
```

### CRITICAL BUG: Race Condition in Character Update Loop
**File:** lib/character/behavior.go:590-620  
**Severity:** High
**Description:** The Character.Update() method accesses gameState and other shared state without proper mutex protection, while other methods like HandleClick() properly use mu.Lock(). This creates a race condition when Update() runs concurrently with user interactions.
**Expected Behavior:** All shared state access should be protected by mutex to ensure thread safety
**Actual Behavior:** Update() method reads and modifies shared state without locking, causing potential data races
**Impact:** Potential data corruption, inconsistent state, and crashes under concurrent access patterns
**Reproduction:**
1. Run companion with game mode: `go run cmd/companion/main.go -game -character assets/characters/easy/character.json`
2. Rapidly click character while stats are updating
3. Use race detector: `go run -race cmd/companion/main.go -game`
**Code Reference:**
```go
// lib/character/behavior.go:590-620  
func (c *Character) Update() []AchievementDetails {
    // Missing: c.mu.Lock() / defer c.mu.Unlock()
    if c.gameState != nil {
        // Accesses shared state without protection
        newAchievements := c.gameState.Update()
        // ... more unprotected state access
    }
    return newAchievements // Potential race condition
}
```
