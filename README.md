## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.21 or higher
- C compiler (gcc/clang) for CGO dependencies
- Platform-specific requirements:
  - **Linux**: X11 development libraries (`libx11-dev`, `libxcursor-dev`, `libxrandr-dev`, `libxinerama-dev`, `libxi-dev`, `libgl1-mesa-dev`)
  - **macOS**: Xcode command line tools
  - **Windows**: TDM-GCC or Visual Studio Build Tools

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/opd-ai/DDS
cd DDS

# Install dependencies
go mod download

# Add animation GIF files (see SETUP guide below)
# Then run with default character
go run cmd/companion/main.go
```

### 🎬 Animation Setup (Required)

Before running, you need to add GIF animation files:

1. **Create GIF files** in `assets/characters/default/animations/`:
   - `idle.gif` - Default character animation
   - `talking.gif` - Speaking animation  
   - `happy.gif` - Happy/excited animation
   - `sad.gif` - Sad/disappointed animation

2. **GIF Requirements**:
   - Format: Animated GIF with transparency
   - Size: 64x64 to 256x256 pixels  
   - File size: <1MB each for best performance
   - Frames: 2-10 frames per animation

3. **Quick Test Setup**:
   - Download sample pixel art GIFs from Tenor or Giphy
   - Or create simple test animations using online GIF makers
   - See `assets/characters/default/animations/SETUP.md` for details

### Building from Source

```bash
# Development build
go build -o companion cmd/companion/main.go

# Optimized release build  
go build -ldflags="-s -w" -o companion cmd/companion/main.go

# Native build for current platform
make build  # Builds for current platform only
```

## 🏗️ Architecture & Dependencies

This project follows the "lazy programmer" philosophy, using mature libraries instead of custom implementations:

### Primary Dependencies

| Library | License | Purpose | Why Chosen |
|---------|---------|---------|------------|
| [fyne.io/fyne/v2](https://fyne.io/) | BSD-3-Clause | Cross-platform GUI | Only mature Go GUI with native transparency support |
| Go standard library | BSD-3-Clause | JSON parsing, GIF decoding, image processing | Zero external dependencies, battle-tested |

### License Compliance

All dependencies use permissive licenses (BSD-3-Clause) that allow commercial use without attribution requirements. No license files need to be bundled with binaries, but this project includes `LICENSES.md` for transparency.

## 📖 Usage

### Basic Usage

1. **Launch**: Run the executable or `go run cmd/companion/main.go`
2. **Interact**: Click on the character to trigger dialog responses
3. **Move**: Drag the character around your desktop (if enabled)
4. **Configure**: Edit `assets/characters/default/character.json` to customize behavior

### Character Cards

Characters are defined using JSON configuration files with this structure:

```json
{
  "name": "My Desktop Pet",
  "description": "A friendly companion for your desktop",
  "animations": {
    "idle": "animations/idle.gif",
    "talking": "animations/talking.gif",
    "happy": "animations/happy.gif"
  },
  "dialogs": [
    {
      "trigger": "click",
      "responses": [
        "Hello there!",
        "How can I help you today?",
        "Nice to see you again!"
      ],
      "animation": "talking",
      "cooldown": 5
    }
  ],
  "behavior": {
    "idleTimeout": 30,
    "movementEnabled": true,
    "defaultSize": 128
  }
}
```

### Configuration Schema

#### Required Fields

- `name` (string, 1-50 chars): Character display name
- `description` (string, 1-200 chars): Character description
- `animations` (object): Animation file mappings
  - `idle` (string, required): Default animation GIF path
  - `talking` (string, required): Speaking animation GIF path
  - Additional animations (optional): `happy`, `sad`, `excited`, etc.

#### Dialog Configuration

- `trigger` (string): `click`, `rightclick`, or `hover`
- `responses` (array): 1-10 response text strings
- `animation` (string): Animation to play (must exist in `animations`)
- `cooldown` (number): Seconds between dialog triggers (default: 5)

#### Behavior Settings

- `idleTimeout` (number, 10-300): Seconds before returning to idle animation
- `movementEnabled` (boolean): Allow dragging the character (default: false)
- `defaultSize` (number, 64-512): Character size in pixels (default: 128)

#### Game Features (Optional - Phase 1 Available)

Character cards can include optional Tamagotchi-style game features:

```json
{
  "stats": {
    "hunger": {
      "initial": 100,
      "max": 100,
      "degradationRate": 1.0,
      "criticalThreshold": 20
    }
  },
  "gameRules": {
    "statsDecayInterval": 60,
    "autoSaveInterval": 300,
    "criticalStateAnimationPriority": true
  },
  "interactions": {
    "feed": {
      "triggers": ["rightclick"],
      "effects": {"hunger": 25},
      "animations": ["eating"],
      "responses": ["Yum! Thank you!"],
      "cooldown": 30
    }
  }
}
```

**Game Feature Configuration:**
- `stats`: Define character stats (hunger, happiness, health, energy) with degradation rates
- `gameRules`: Configure game mechanics (decay intervals, auto-save, animation priorities)
- `interactions`: Define game interactions (feed, play, pet) with stat effects

For complete game features documentation, see `GAME_FEATURES_PHASE1.md`.

### Creating Custom Characters

1. **Create character directory**:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p assets/characters/mycharacter/animations
   ```

2. **Add GIF animations**:
   - Ensure GIFs have transparency for best results
   - Recommended size: 64x64 to 256x256 pixels
   - Keep file sizes under 1MB each for performance

3. **Create character.json**:
   ```bash
   cp assets/characters/default/character.json assets/characters/mycharacter/
   # Edit the configuration file
   ```

4. **Load custom character**:
   ```bash
   go run cmd/companion/main.go -character assets/characters/mycharacter/character.json
   ```

### Design Principles

1. **Library-First**: Use existing solutions instead of custom implementations
2. **Standard Library Preference**: Leverage Go's stdlib (json, image/gif) when possible
3. **Minimal Custom Code**: Write only glue code and business logic
4. **Interface-Based**: Use standard Go patterns for testability
5. **Proper Concurrency**: Mutex protection for all shared state

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests with coverage
go test ./... -v -cover

# Run specific package tests
go test ./internal/character -v

# Run with race detection
go test ./... -race

# Generate coverage report
go test ./... -coverprofile=coverage.out
go tool cover -html=coverage.out
```

### Performance Monitoring

The application includes built-in performance monitoring and profiling:

```bash
# Run with memory profiling
go run cmd/companion/main.go -memprofile=mem.prof

# Run with CPU profiling  
go run cmd/companion/main.go -cpuprofile=cpu.prof

# Run with both profiles and debug output
go run cmd/companion/main.go -memprofile=mem.prof -cpuprofile=cpu.prof -debug

# Analyze profiles
go tool pprof mem.prof
go tool pprof cpu.prof
```

**Performance Targets**:
- Memory usage: <50MB during normal operation ✅ **MONITORED**
- Animation framerate: 30+ FPS consistently ✅ **MONITORED**
- Startup time: <2 seconds ✅ **MONITORED**

**Real-time Monitoring**:
- Memory usage tracking with target validation
- Frame rate monitoring with performance warnings
- Startup time measurement
- Concurrent frame rendering support
- Automatic performance target validation

## 🔨 Building and Distribution

### Development Builds

```bash
# Local development
go run cmd/companion/main.go

# With custom character
go run cmd/companion/main.go -character path/to/character.json

# With debug logging
go run cmd/companion/main.go -debug
```

### Release Builds

```bash
# Native build for current platform
go build -ldflags="-s -w" -o companion cmd/companion/main.go

# Using Makefile
make build  # Creates build/companion
```

> **Note**: Due to Fyne GUI framework limitations, cross-platform builds are not supported.  
> Fyne requires platform-specific CGO libraries for graphics drivers.  
> Build on the target platform for proper binary distribution.
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"failed to initialize display" (Linux)**:
```bash
# Install required X11 libraries
sudo apt-get install libx11-dev libxcursor-dev libxrandr-dev libxinerama-dev libxi-dev libgl1-mesa-dev
```

**"character.json not found"**:
- Ensure the character directory contains a valid `character.json` file
- Check file paths are relative to the character.json location
- Verify all referenced GIF files exist

**Poor animation performance**:
- Reduce GIF file sizes (optimize with tools like `gifsicle`)
- Lower GIF frame rates to 10-15 FPS
- Ensure character size is reasonable (64-256 pixels)

**Window not staying on top (Linux)**:
- Some window managers don't support always-on-top hints
- Try different desktop environments (GNOME, KDE, XFCE)
- Check window manager documentation for overlay support

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging for troubleshooting:

```bash
go run cmd/companion/main.go -debug
```

This provides detailed output about:
- Character card loading and validation
- Animation file processing
- Window creation and positioning
- Performance metrics and memory usage

For additional help, see the debug output above or check `AUDIT.md` for known issues and resolutions.
