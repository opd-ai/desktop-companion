# Desktop Companion (DDS)

## ComfyUI GIF Asset Pipeline

The DDS project includes an automated pipeline for generating GIF character animations using a local ComfyUI instance. This system supports all 19 character archetypes and ensures consistent quality and style across assets.

### Usage

1. Start ComfyUI locally (`http://localhost:8188`).
2. Configure generation parameters in `config.json`.
3. Run asset generation:
  ```bash
  gif-generator batch --config batch_config.json --parallel 4
  ```
4. Validate and deploy assets:
  ```bash
  gif-generator validate --path assets/characters/
  gif-generator deploy --source generated/ --target assets/characters/
  ```

See [GIF_PLAN.md](GIF_PLAN.md) for technical details and troubleshooting.

## Android Build Testing

Automated APK integrity testing is provided for CI/CD validation. The script `scripts/apk_integrity/apk_integrity_test.go` checks APK existence, signature, and package name using Android SDK tools (`apksigner`, `aapt`).

### Usage

1. Build your APK (see Fyne mobile docs).
2. Run the test:
  ```bash
  ./scripts/test-android-apk.sh path/to/app.apk com.example.package
  ```
3. The script will fail if the APK is missing, unsigned, or has the wrong package name.

See `scripts/apk_integrity/apk_integrity_test.go` for details.

## Network Connection Recovery

The multiplayer networking system uses a `ConnectionManager` to handle connection lifecycle, error recovery, and reconnection with exponential backoff. All network operations use Go's standard library and interface types for testability.

### Features

- Automatic reconnection on failure (with exponential backoff)
- Explicit error handling for connection loss and timeouts
- Thread-safe connection state
- Unit tests for recovery logic and error scenarios

See `lib/network/connection.go` for implementation details.

## Performance Optimization

The application includes memory optimization features to reduce garbage collection pressure and improve performance. The `lib/performance` package provides object pools using `sync.Pool` for frequently allocated types.

### Memory Pools

- **Character State Pool**: Reuses character state objects during updates
- **Animation Frame Pool**: Optimizes memory usage during animation processing  
- **Network Message Pool**: Reduces allocations for network communication

Usage example:
```go
// Get from pool, use, then return
cs := performance.GetCharacterState()
cs.Health = 100
// ... use character state ...
performance.PutCharacterState(cs) // Must return to prevent leaks
```

See `lib/performance/pool.go` for details and benchmarks.

## Advanced Dialog Context Enhancement

The dialog system includes advanced conversation context tracking for more natural and contextually aware responses. The `ConversationContext` tracks topics, emotional state, and conversation history to generate better responses.

### Features

- **Topic Detection**: Automatically identifies conversation topics (weather, feelings, activities, food, health)
- **Emotional State Tracking**: Monitors valence, arousal, and dominance in conversations
- **Message History**: Maintains recent conversation context for better continuity
- **Context-Aware Responses**: Markov chain backend uses conversation context to enhance response quality

### Integration

The Markov chain backend automatically:
- Updates conversation context with each message
- Enhances responses with detected topics and emotional state
- Provides context summaries for debugging and analysis

Usage example:
```go
// Context is automatically managed by dialog backends
context := dialog.NewConversationContext()
context.AddMessage(ctx, "I feel happy about the sunny weather")

// Get current state
activeTopics := context.GetActiveTopics() // ["weather", "feelings"]
summary := context.GetContextSummary()   // "discussing weather"
emotional := context.EmotionalState      // Positive valence, moderate arousal
```

See `lib/dialog/context.go` for implementation details and `context_test.go` for usage examples.

**Game Feature Configuration**:

- **Stats System**: Define character stats (hunger, happiness, health, energy) with individual degradation rates and critical thresholds
- **Game Rules**: Configure game mechanics including decay intervals, auto-save frequency, and feature toggles
- **Interactions**: Define game interactions (feed, play, pet) with stat effects, requirements, cooldowns, and animations
- **Progression System**: Age-based evolution with size changes and animation overrides
- **Achievement System**: Track milestones with complex stat-based requirements and reward stat boosts
- **Random Events**: Probability-based events that can positively or negatively affect character stats
- **Critical State Handling**: Special animations and responses when stats drop below thresholds
- **Mood-Based Animation Selection**: Dynamic idle animation selection based on overall character mood

**Available Difficulty Levels**:
- **Easy** (`assets/characters/easy/`): Slower stat degradation, easier requirements
- **Normal** (`assets/characters/normal/`): Balanced gameplay for regular users
- **Hard** (`assets/characters/hard/`): Faster stat degradation, more challenging requirements
- **Challenge** (`assets/characters/challenge/`): Extreme difficulty for expert players

### Creating Custom Characters

1. **Create character directory**:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p assets/characters/mycharacter/animations
   ```

2. **Add GIF animations**:
   - Ensure GIFs have transparency for best results
   - Recommended size: 64x64 to 256x256 pixels
   - Keep file sizes under 1MB each for performance

3. **Create character.json**:
   ```bash
   cp assets/characters/default/character.json assets/characters/mycharacter/
   # Edit the configuration file
   ```

4. **Load custom character**:
   ```bash
   go run cmd/companion/main.go -character assets/characters/mycharacter/character.json
   ```

### Design Principles

1. **Library-First**: Use existing solutions instead of custom implementations
2. **Standard Library Preference**: Leverage Go's stdlib (json, image/gif) when possible
3. **Minimal Custom Code**: Write only glue code and business logic
4. **Interface-Based**: Use standard Go patterns for testability
5. **Proper Concurrency**: Mutex protection for all shared state

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests with coverage
go test ./... -v -cover

# Run specific package tests
go test ./lib/character -v

# Run with race detection
go test ./... -race

# Generate coverage report
go test ./... -coverprofile=coverage.out
go tool cover -html=coverage.out
```

### Performance Monitoring

The application includes built-in performance monitoring and profiling:

```bash
# Run with memory profiling
go run cmd/companion/main.go -memprofile=mem.prof

# Run with CPU profiling  
go run cmd/companion/main.go -cpuprofile=cpu.prof

# Run with both profiles and debug output
go run cmd/companion/main.go -memprofile=mem.prof -cpuprofile=cpu.prof -debug

# Analyze profiles
go tool pprof mem.prof
go tool pprof cpu.prof
```

**Real-time Monitoring**:
- Memory usage tracking and reporting
- Frame rate monitoring with performance warnings
- Startup time measurement
- Concurrent frame rendering support
- Built-in performance profiling capabilities

## üî® Building and Distribution

### Development Builds

```bash
# Local development
go run cmd/companion/main.go

# With custom character
go run cmd/companion/main.go -character path/to/character.json

# With debug logging
go run cmd/companion/main.go -debug
```

### Release Builds

```bash
# Native build for current platform
go build -ldflags="-s -w" -o companion cmd/companion/main.go

# Using Makefile
make build  # Creates build/companion
```

> **Note**: Due to Fyne GUI framework limitations, cross-compilation is not supported.  
> Fyne requires platform-specific CGO libraries for graphics drivers.  
> Build on the target platform for proper binary distribution.

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"failed to initialize display" (Linux)**:
```bash
# Install required X11 libraries
sudo apt-get install libx11-dev libxcursor-dev libxrandr-dev libxinerama-dev libxi-dev libgl1-mesa-dev
```

**"character.json not found"**:
- Ensure the character directory contains a valid `character.json` file
- Check file paths are relative to the character.json location
- Verify all referenced GIF files exist

**Poor animation performance**:
- Reduce GIF file sizes (optimize with tools like `gifsicle`)
- Lower GIF frame rates to 10-15 FPS
- Ensure character size is reasonable (64-256 pixels)

**Window not staying on top (Linux)**:
- Some window managers don't support always-on-top hints
- Try different desktop environments (GNOME, KDE, XFCE)
- Check window manager documentation for overlay support

**Game features not working**:
- Ensure you're using the `-game` flag to enable Tamagotchi features
- Use character cards with game features (e.g., `character_with_game_features.json`)
- Check that the character card has `stats`, `interactions`, and `gameRules` sections

**Stats overlay not visible**:
- Ensure both `-game` and `-stats` flags are enabled
- Try pressing the 'S' key to toggle stats overlay
- Verify the character card has valid stats configuration

**Save game not loading**:
- Check permissions on save directory (`~/.local/share/desktop-companion/`)
- Ensure character name matches between save file and character card
- Try starting fresh if save file is corrupted (will auto-regenerate)

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging for troubleshooting:

```bash
go run cmd/companion/main.go -debug
```

This provides detailed output about:
- Character card loading and validation
- Animation file processing
- Window creation and positioning
- Performance metrics and memory usage
- Game state updates and stat changes (in game mode)
- Save/load operations and persistence
- Achievement progress and random events (in game mode)

For additional help, see the debug output above or check `AUDIT.md` for known issues and resolutions.
