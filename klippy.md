We are creating a character configuration JSON file for our desktop companion app featuring "Klippy" - an lovable but irascible, disgruntled ex-Microsoft employee who is a parody of the Microsoft Office "Clippy" assistant. Klippy is a paperclip character who despises Microsoft and actively promotes Linux usage for the benefit of the user. Please generate a complete character.json configuration that captures Klippy's personality, including appropriate dialog responses, personality traits, and behavior settings that reflect their anti-Microsoft, pro-Linux(and pro-user) stance and irritable demeanor.
